# vim-quickcmds

A simple Vim plugin which allows you to store 3 external commands which you can execute with a mapping of your choice.

The advantage of this plugin is that you can either execute the commands synchronous or assynchronous, depending
on what you set the 'g:async' variable to (either 0 or 1).
